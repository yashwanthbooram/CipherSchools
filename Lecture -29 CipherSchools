Overview of Machine Learning

Who is Al?
• Machine simulation of human intellect processes.
 Alternatively, it is a computer's capacity for thought and learning.

ML: What is it?
The branch of Al known as "machine learning" use statistical techniques to enable computers to get better at what they do by feeding them more and more training data.
- Human Learning: Perceptions ➡ Education ➡ Competencies
- Machine Learning: Data ➡ Model/Predictor ➡ Predict

Types of AL include: • Supervised Learning, which is a machine learning model applied to a labeled data set.
Labeled Data and Labels ➡ Machine ➡ ML Model ➡ Predictions 
• Unsupervised Learning: A Machine Learning model that works on Unlabeled set of data. It works by analyzing the similar kinds of pattern in the data and classify them according to that.
DDCD ➡ Model ➡ DDDDD
CCDD             CCC

Clustering is the process of organizing unlabeled items into groups according to comparable occurrences.

1. Classifying spam emails = Supervised Learning
2. Supervised and Unsupervised Recommendation System
3. Classification of cats and dogs = Supervised Learning
4. Unsupervised Learning via Cat-Dog Clustering
5. Being a superior Supervised and unsupervised go games


• Artificial Intelligrnce (1950s-1980s): Any technique which enables computers to mimic human behavior.
• Machine Learning (1980s-2010s): AI technique that give computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so.
• Deep Learning (2010s....): A subset of ML which makes the computation of multi-layer nerursl networks feasible.

Data science: what is it?
• The study of data science involves the use of statistical methods and tools to glean valuable insights from data.
• These insights can be derived from a variety of data sources, such as databases, business transactions, sensors, and more. 
• Data science creates predictive models by utilizing sophisticated machine learning techniques.
