Building Reports And Dashboards

How Can I Make a Basic Dashboard?

Here's the dataset that was used: Human Resources Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/
Step 1 is data import.
Upon launching the Power BI program, the initial step is to obtain access to your data.
Any format can be used to import your dataset with ease.
Next, select the Get Data button that is situated in the screen's middle left corner.
The Files option is displayed in the navigation pane. 
After selecting Files, navigate to the location of your Excel workbook or any other format. After selecting your file, press the Connect button.
Processing takes a little while, depending on the size of the file.
Click the Load button after confirming that the data has been extracted.


Step2: Examine Your Information.
You may view the data in tabular form by selecting the Data tab.
There is a list of fields in those tables on the right. 
To apply formatting operations to a table or field, you can pick them. 
You can modify the datatype or format of any fields, including date, time, city, state, percentage value, currency, etc., from the Modeling tab.

Step 3: Select the Appropriate Chart.
We therefore choose to focus on five data for our dashboard: 
EmployerId, Position, Hiredyear, RecruitmentSource, and male-female employment.
A card will be the first visualization we create. From the visualizations section, choose Card.
From the Fields section, choose which columns you wish to include to the graphic. 
Additionally, you can drag & drop the fields into the appropriate columns as seen in the image below. 
By selecting columns and using filters, you can format the image using the Format icon.
The total number of employers is displayed on the first card that we made. 
The remaining cards underwent the same processes. 
The maximum salary, positions, and number of recruitment sources are displayed on the second, third, and fourth cards, accordingly.
Subsequently, we will generate a Pie Chart and a Donut Chart to display the number of positions and the male-female rate, respectively. 
Include this Visualizations chart. 
To display the number of hires annually and the recruitment source proportionately, add a funnel and stacked bar chart at the end. 
Arrange the plot area, axes, legend, data labels, title, and colors, among other elements.

Top Tips for Creating a Successful Dashboard: • Recognize your audience.
• Summarize the plot right away.
• Utilize the full screen.
• Emphasize the data that is most pertinent.
• Put the most crucial details in the upper left corner.
• Make use of the appropriate visuals.
• Make restricted use of filters and slicers.
• Toothlessly lowers the number. i.e., Finish the number rounding.

Avoid these common mistakes: • Inaccurate labeling inside the dashboard.
• Excessive Color Use.
• An abundance of slicers.
• Bringing in All of the Data.
• Get rid of any unnecessary visual interactions.
